Calculates your typing speed (WPM, words per minute) after typing some text.

## Roadmap

- Fetch quotes from somewhere.
- Let users put their own quote.
- Record the quotes times.
- Associate the WPM to a setup or description, eg: "Leopold FC660C, at the office"
- Optional instant WPM with graph.
- Save times and settings to local storage.
